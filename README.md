Intro
-------------

airfront.co.uk - frontend skeleton. right from the off I'm going to declare that I'm not a total expert on the most of the technologies/frameworks I'm employing here. I'm cobbling together the knowledge and experience I do have in order to achieve my perfect front-end framework for writing HTML+CSS+Javascript.

If you see something you think can be re-factored then feel free to explain why and make a pull request. I'm always happy when somebody teaches me a better or new way of doing things.
