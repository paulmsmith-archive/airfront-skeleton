airfront-site
=============

airfront.co.uk - frontend skeleton. A combination of ruby (middleman) & nodejs (gulp+bower).

Intro
-------------

Straight from the off I'm going to declare that I'm not a total expert on the most of the technologies/frameworks I'm employing here. I'm cobbling together the knowledge and experience I do have in order to achieve my perfect front-end framework for writing HTML+CSS+Javascript.

If you see something you think can be re-factored then feel free to explain why and make a pull request. I'm always happy when somebody teaches me a better or new way of doing things.

Getting started
-------------

Requirements:

- Ruby 1.9.3+
To check what version you have you can do:
```
ruby -v
```
- NodeJS v0.10.26+

Clone this repo onto your machine and browse to it's root working directory.
